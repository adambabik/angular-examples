This project _makes makes no modifications_ to the stock AngularJS build.\n\nThis branch contains the exploded [`angular-1.1.4.zip`](http://code.angularjs.org/1.1.4/angular-1.1.4.zip) archive.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo avoid conflicts with the official AngularJS bowser package, this package will remain unregistered. To use it, add the following to your Bower dependencies.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\" : {\n    \"angular\" : \"git@github.com:PatternConsulting/bower-angular.git#1.1.4\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note that _1.1.4_ refers to the tag**, which corresponds to the AngularJS release. Visit the [_tags_](https://github.com/PatternConsulting/bower-angular/tags) list to see available versions, and [usage notes on Bower dependencies](https://github.com/bower/bower#usage) for details.\n\n## Branches\n\nThe `master` branch does not contain any AngularJS distribution. Our [`stable`](https://github.com/PatternConsulting/bower-angular/tree/stable) and [`unstable`](https://github.com/PatternConsulting/bower-angular/tree/unstable) branches track with the respective AngularJS branches.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis is package is slightly duplicative with [bower-angular](https://github.com/angular/bower-angular), but intends to maintain packages for both the stable and unstable AngularJS branches.\n",
